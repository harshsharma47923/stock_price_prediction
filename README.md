# stock_price_prediction
This is my stock price prediction model with web app.
I have various machine learning model like Linear Regression, LSTM in making this complete project.
This model is trained on the machine learning model and used historical stock data to train itself and make prediction out of it.
The model is then linked to an web app made using streamlit.
